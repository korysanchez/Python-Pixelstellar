Pixelstellar is a project in which you explore randomly generated planets. At each planet you can probe different aspects of it's generation. Currently there is no gameplay, just travelling to the next planet.

Coded purely in python utilizing the standard tkinter toolkit



### Notes

Pixelstellar is a game that I have always wanted to create. The main inspiration was from a game I had played from a number of years ago named "Seedship." I had created a simple version of it in high school using windows batch scripting. Later when I learned python it was my first project that I attempted to create. Using tkinter as a basic and quick starting ground, I was able to quickly create a small project, and kept adding from there. I found a lot of joy in being able to edit the windows directly.

### Usage
